## Research Questions:
The experiment data relates to a field experiment that aimed to test what type of language is most effective at encouraging college students to apply for CalFresh, Californiaâ€™s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Specifically, this study sought to answer the following research questions:
1. Does sending an informational message to students who are likely eligible for CalFresh increase their likelihood of applying relative to no message?
2. Does sending a social norms message to students who are likely eligible for CalFresh increase their likelihood of applying relative to no message?
3. Does sending a social norms message to students who are likely eligible for CalFresh increase their likelihood of applying relative to an informational message?

## About the study:
The study sample is composed of 62,773 college students in two counties in California who were identified as being likely eligible for CalFresh. In stratified randomization, all college students were randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions with equal probability:
1. Control: Students in the control group did not receive any communication as part of this study.
2. Information: Students in the information group received a simple informational email with instructions for enrolling in CalFresh.
3. Social norms: Students in the social norms group received an email with instructions for enrolling in CalFresh, as well as information on how many other students in California have already enrolled.
The randomization was stratified by county.

The experiment was conducted in all universities in two different California counties (variable county). After we collected the data related to the experiment (Experiment data.csv), we asked both counties to send demographic data of their students to use as covariates; they were sent in different files (County 1 data.csv and County 2 data.csv).

### Important Variables
- Control_Condition: 1 = assignment to the control condition
- Info_Condition: 1 = assignment to the information condition
- Norms_Condition: 1 = assignment to the social norms condition
- Applied: 1 = Submitted an application for CalFresh; Other Numbers = Did not submit an application for CalFresh

## The Stata Code
The Stata code:
- Prepares the files for merge, creating an unique ID, standardizing variable and dealing with repeated observations;
- Merges the Experiment data with the County data;
- Runs linear probability models to answer the research questions.
